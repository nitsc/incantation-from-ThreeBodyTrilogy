# Python Implementation of Incantation from *The Three-Body Trilogy*

## Overview
This project implements a process that extrapolates from Gaia stellar data to 3D visualizations, three-view projections, signal generation, audio translation of signals, and their inversions. It demonstrates the feasibility of the "incantation" logic from *The Three-Body Problem* trilogy.

## Usage Notes
- Place the 'incantation-from-ThreeBodyTrilogy-main' folder in `D:\temp` for the program to work properly. Alternatively, you can modify the paths in the program to match your environment.
- Output data will be saved on the desktop to avoid overwriting the provided results (including three-view projections, signal files, and audio).
- Please refrain from playing the generated audio at high volume, in accordance with the "Dark Forest Theory."

# The Incantation from *The Three-Body Trilogy* (from 三体Wiki, translated by DeepL)

## Overview of the Dark Forest Theory
The Dark Forest Theory posits that any civilization that reveals itself is doomed to destruction by other civilizations in the universe.

## Key Elements
### Two Main Axioms:
1. Survival is the primary need of a civilization.
2. Civilizations grow and expand, but the total matter in the universe is constant.

### Two Concepts:
- Chain of Guesses
- Technological Explosion

## Reason for the Theory
Civilizations need to acquire resources for survival and expansion, but they compete in a limited universe. This competition leads to "technological explosions," which allow lower civilizations to potentially surpass higher ones. A "chain of suspicion" arises from the mutual uncertainty between civilizations, creating a hostile environment where higher civilizations often opt to destroy rather than communicate.

## Derivation Process
- From the conservation of matter and the expansion of civilizations, we derive the fundamental contradictions between civilizations.
- When Civilization A discovers Civilization B, A must judge B’s intentions:
  1. Communicating with B forms a chain of suspicion, while revealing A’s presence. If B is equally advanced, it poses a threat; if less advanced, a technological explosion could quickly make B dangerous.
  2. Hiding from B leads to similar outcomes once B develops its own technology.

In both scenarios, A concludes that the only safe option is to destroy B, reinforcing the theory.

## Incantation Experiment Theory
Luo Ji's "incantation experiment" confirms several facts:
1. Higher civilizations possess powerful weapons.
2. Dark Forest strikes are timely and accurate.
3. Higher civilizations prefer to attack rather than detect.

## Flaws
The theory is strong but based on a single observation, not multiple experiments. This led to skepticism in the Post-Deterrence Era, until the strike on the Trisolaran galaxy during the Broadcast Era.

## Historical Examples
- Columbus’ discovery of the Americas led to the Spanish colonization and the destruction of Indigenous civilizations.
- British colonization of Australia involved the mass killing of Indigenous peoples.

## Remarks
- The Dark Forest Theory is a natural extension of Darwin and Wallace’s "doctrine of natural selection."
- Luo Ji’s famous line, "others are hell," is a nod to existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.
- "The universe is a dark forest, and every civilization is a hunter, creeping through the forest like a ghost..."
