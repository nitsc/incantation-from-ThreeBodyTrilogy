# incantation-from-ThreeBodyTrilogy
---
## Overview
Implemented the process of extrapolating from Gaia stellar data, to 3D visualizations, to three-views, to three-view signals, to three-view audio of signals, and even their inversions. This project proves the feasibility of the Logic (Luoji)'s “incantation” from “The Three Body Problem” trilogy.

## Notes on usage
- The 'incantation-from-ThreeBodyTrilogy-main' folder should be placed in 'D:\temp', otherwise the program file will not work properly. Of course, you can change the paths in the program files to the paths that apply to your computer.

- The data generated by the program will be saved on the desktop in order not to overwrite the results I have provided (including the three views, signal files, and audio).

- Please do not broadcast audio with high power, according to the 'Dark Forest Law'.
